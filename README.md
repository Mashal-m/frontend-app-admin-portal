# edx-portal

## Overview
edx-portal is a frontend that provides branded learning experiences as well as a dashboard for enterprise learning administrators.

## Setting up a dev environment

### The Short Story

1. Set up docker devstack locally, and start the service containers (see https://github.com/edx/devstack)

2. Set up and run the edx-analytics-data-api (https://github.com/edx/edx-analytics-data-api) locally

3. Clone this repo and install npm requirements:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:edx/edx-portal.git
$ cd edx-portal
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The application is now running and can be accessed in a web browser at http://localhost:1991/


### The Longer Story

For the edx-portal to function properly locally, the following parts need to be set up:

1. OAuth communication between `edx-portal` and LMS
2. At least 1 enterprise customer should exist in `edx-platform`
3. `edx-analytics-data-api` needs data that would normally be piped from `edx-platform` via data pipelines


#### OAuth

The edx-portal first needs permission to communicate with the LMS. These permissions are handled with the Django OAuth Toolkit. To set up the OAuth permissions, you can do the following:

1. Navigate to local LMS django admin's OAuth Application page (something like http://localhost:18000/admin/oauth2_provider/application/)
2. Click the "Add Application" button
3. Set the user to edx. This form takes the ID of the provisioned user, so it is advisable to use the search button next to the text field to search for "edx"
4. Set the "Client type" to "public"
5. Set the "Authorization grant type" to "Resource owner password-based"
6. Click "Save"

With the application created, you should take note of the "Client ID" value for the user you just created (it is a jumble of numbers and letters). In your `edx-portal` checkout, in `config/webpack.dev.config.js`, set the `LMS_CLIENT_ID` variable's value to the "Client ID" value.

#### Enterprise Customer

The `edx-portal` displays information about enterprise customers in `edx-platform`, so you will need to create a customer in `edx-platform`. You can create a customer by doing the following:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:18000/admin/enterprise/enterprisecustomer/
2. Click "Add Enterprise Customer"
3. Complete this form, at very least filling in the Name, Slug, and Site
4. Click "Save"

Once created, make a note of the UUID field in the admin for the enterprise customer you created. This is needed to map the data in `edx-platform` to the data in `edx-analytics-data-api`.

#### Analytics-data-api Data Prep

Follow the instructions for how to get data into the edx-analytics-data-api in the repo README here: https://github.com/edx/edx-analytics-data-api, using the UUID for the enterprise customer you just created.

#### Bringing it all together

At this point, if the LMS *and* `data-analytics-api` are running, you should then be able to:

1. Run the `edx-portal` locally

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

2. Login with credentials that you could log into your local edx-platform with

3. See data displayed in the the portal

## Using Demo Data
This frontend application uses the [edx-enterprise-data-api](https://github.com/edx/edx-analytics-data-api/) as a backend API for data.
To support scenarios where demonstration data is required or the API is not available, we also generate a script that can be loaded that will
return static demo data instead of hitting the API. To enable:
- In production: Load `demoDataLoader.js` to the page using [a bookmarklet](https://codepen.io/edx/live/e5f46af8f39968b9693c8414091f6cc3/)
- In development: Uncomment the entrypoint `../src/demo/index.js` in `webpack.dev.config.js`
